      <h2>What is the project (non-technical description)?</h2>
      <a>The aim of this project is to create a web application for 
      users to monitor their dietary needs and prevent the consumption 
      of any food that triggers the user's allergy. 
      We do this by collecting data about the user's diet, 
      nd their allergy, then using text recognition, scan and monitor 
      the ingredients in their foods to make recommendations on their 
      next grocery or food consumption. (based on the allergy and safety of the food).<a>
      <h2>What is the need for this project, impact, benefits? What is the impact if this project doesn't get built?</h2>
      <a>Many people buy and consume foods that have some harmful hidden ingredients. Being able to monitor what you eat and keep track of those hidden ingredients used by food producers can have a beneficial impact on millions of people. It can save money and life. Researchers found out that food allergies cost about $25 billion each year and estimated that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. Thatâ€™s one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom. The impact of not having this project for use, is the suffering of those people and the huge amount of money spent each year battling this preventable issue.</a>
      <h2>Who will use the output of this project?</h2>
      <a>Can be used by people that have allergies, or someone shopping for ingredients that don't want to include food that can cause allergies, Or even people who would want to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</a>
